              There are several unmet needs that this multi-University lab will address. First and foremost, while UK academia hosts world-leading public opinion researchers and survey methodologists, they are often isolated across different institutions, resulting in inefficiently duplicated research activities and limited collaboration. Secondly, the rise of AI represents a critical pressure point for survey research: building synergies to turbocharge methodological innovation is an immediate priority. Thirdly, the connection between public opinion scholars, political campaigns, the media, and the public is often weak, placing excessive strain on a few renowned academics who often must decline the numerous requests. Partiesâ€™ HQ and NGOs/advocacies, furthermore, often need flexible and short-term academic advice but do not know how to procure it quickly and efficiently. Fourthly, navigating polling and elections is often rife with misinformation for voters and political representatives, and, in addition, there is an unmet need for AI and computational skills in our current political behaviour teaching offer.

            The Public Opinion Analytics Lab (POAL) is a pioneering academic collaboration between the University of Reading (UoR), the London School of Economics (LSE), and the University of Southampton (SOTON), designed to advance the research, teaching, and practice of public opinion and political behaviour measurement and analysis. The lab is a collaborative, cross-institutional hub that attracts leading scholars and practitioners in public opinion research working to cultivate democratic resilience and accountability by supporting large-scale national election studies and comparative public opinion datasets, by rigorously testing and disseminating innovative methods of public opinion measurement, and by fostering a more informed, engaged electorate. Its focus will be truly global: we have experts on US, European, Latin American and African politics, as well as on UK politics.
